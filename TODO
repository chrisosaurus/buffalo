codes TODO:
codes.* will eventually become its own library, maybe stw (simple termcode wrapper) 'stew'


buffalo TODO:
deal with text off the right of the screen (wordwrap OR scroll over, later seems easier)
save as
open(run time specified file, possibly with another already open)
goto matching bracket (simple 'stack' counter, will fail for non literals but meh)
syntax highlighting
undo

bugs:
fix search backwards so it will search cur.l[ 0 : cur.o ] <- need to find a tidy solution
highlighting when selection start is before screen and selection end is on screen, doesnt highlight but should <- hard to do in current model
optimisation of drawing when scrolling <- not really a priority

tidyup:
i_backspace, should seperate into 2 methods. One is i_backspace which deals with moving selection and then calls i_delete which removes previous char.
i_insert, should also be 2 funcs. One sets/extends selection and then calls the other, tab and newline should use the former. Reading a new file should use the latter.
