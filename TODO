internal:
  load
  save
  cursor movement
  insertion
  modal/non modal - defined at compile time
  literal insert
  cut (char, word, line, region)
  paste

  extras:
    line numbers
    showing certain characters (non printable ie esc, end of lines, end of files, non uses space, etc.)
    'plain' mode, all colours, line numbers, extra chars turned off (so copying/pasting is 'flawless').
    ability to paste to xclip

external:
  search - grep?
  find/replace - sed?
  syntax highlighting
  bracket matching
  fix style/indentation

codes.* will eventually become its own library, maybe stw (simple termcode wrapper) 'stew'
syntax highlighting is own tool (run on a line every time that line is modified)
bracket matching requires whole file or atleast large chunk OR can use a stack of applied colours and a 'next colour' pointer
style/indentation is only run on users request so can be 'expensive', will require understanding of brackets so tools can be combined


consider:
  lazy load
  storing text
  multiple buffers (function of editor or environment (wm,shell,tabbed, etc.))
