in a key such as
-----
top
bottom
-----
top is the uppercase and bottom is the lower case bindings
all keys are bound against a mod (alt or ctrl)

SOF/EOF SOL/EOL start of/end of line or file
\nbf \naf insert new line before/after current and place curs there
uscr/dscr are moving by screens
uchr/dchr/lchr/rchar moving by chars
lwrd/rwrd moving by word/tokens (whitespace or non alphanumeric?)
smk set mark
g&smk goto mark and then set at old pos
read open a new file (name in selection or re read curfile if none )
run runs command in current with selection as its stdin, inserting at pos and removing current
balgn/talgn make current line either top or bottom of screen
was = write as (save file as filename in current selection)
findB/findF search (using current copied text as input) Backwards/Fowards
sels/sele = set selection start/end to cur
clsel = clear selection

need to consider:
goto line number, how do we get line number? selection, possibly use the binding (maybe r under undo?)
search from buffer / copy and search / cut and search
soft selection (typing is into a selection), is this a second selection or does it cancel the first?
delete (D) is too close to cut (S)
